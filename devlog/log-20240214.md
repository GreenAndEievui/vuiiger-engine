Rather than spend my time on this game, I've been sinking way too much into a "sequel".

This project is mature enough that I'm sure I can finish it whenever I find the motivation to push through the last few levels,
so I'm not particularly concerned with abondoning it in favor of another one.
However, whenever I had an idea that's exciting enough for me to start working on this,
I usually gravitate away from the Game Boy engine because it feels more like a finished project that I shouldn't touch.
It's a little bit unimaginateive because there's plenty I could be doing to polish up this game and make it more fun to play,
even if it's short.

Something I've been really interested in lately is having more dynamic console messages.
I spent a lot of time making a system for this in Rust, but I think it'd actually be even easier in this engine
since text is formatted directly onto the screen.
The biggest challenge is probably going to be allowing each move to print its own "self used move!" message,
but from what I remember about adding new move animations this will probably be easier than it seems.

# Reworking moves

A complaint I got about this game's moves is that they all feel about the same.
Lunge is especially bad because it doesn't give any indication that it's reaching farther when you use it;
a lunging animation would go a long way.
I think the issue is that I don't want these moves to feel like Pokemon moves, even though they were designed to be very similar.

- It might be worth creating a new "spell" for each character, and removing bite to make room for it.
- Since the game is probably going to get projectiles soon, it probably makes sense to give Luvui a ranged spell.
- Aris's first spell could be "growl" or something that occasionally prevents enemies from attacking.
- I don't want aris to have any damaging spells; instead, he should recieve slash so that he's a more competent melee attacker than luvui.
- Fatigue should be renamed to "SP" instead if the game is going to have more spells.
  - Lunge's cost could be removed to compensate for this.
  - it would probably help to display this on the status bar; may need to use progress bars instead of just numbers. (or a very skinny font!)
- I also think move upgrades are uneccessary and probably a little confusing too.
- Tutorial cutscenes to explain the purpose of each move would be nice.

Speaking of tutorials, the game could use an opening "Level 0" to give some background.
This should just be a floor or two of the forest; level 1 could be shortened too since these will probably be played back-to-back.
