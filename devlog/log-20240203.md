I haven't really touched this game since I started working, which is a shame because I'm still really interested in a lot of the ideas I had.
I have some unused music too which is even more incentive to work on this more, but I haven't made the time in quite a while.

Something that overwhelms me when I try to work on this game has always been the idea of drawing new art any time something new needs to be added.
This comes up *surprisingly often*, and I've a bit too much of a perfectionist to let anything be "programmer art".
Something I envy about traditional ascii roguelikes is how easy it is for them to add new enemies--the only art is choosing a letter and a color for them.
Given that, I think grabbing a 16x16 font and using it as a set of placeholder graphics might not be a bad idea.

Something I've wanted to try out is a dragon enemy for the Blazing Planes; the game's 4th level.
It's a pretty underdeveloped area otherwise, just a re-skinned version of the 2nd level, so I think a unique and gimmicky enemy would be a cool change.
Ever since I decided to leave the 3rd entity slot unused, I've considered using it for projectiles, and I think the dragon should make use of that.
Being able to shoot fireballs would make it a pretty signifigant threat that can't just be A+B'd around.

Another idea I had for these enemies would be to make them ridiculously strong--perhaps unkillable.
The dungeon should be more about escaping before you get toasted than killing everything in sight like you've had to do thus far.
Later floors could add more dragons to up the challenge, and play with layouts to make navigating around enemies a sort of puzzle.
I also considered having "vault" areas, similar to the grottos in level 2.
These would be out of the way and guarded by dragons, making looting them difficult, but rewarding.
The new "Wish" move has three upgrade items, the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, and these could be found within vaults as rare, exclusive items.
Alternatively they could be traded for healing items.
